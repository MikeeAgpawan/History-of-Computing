    The history of computing can go all the way back to the 1300 A.D with the Abacus.
    The abacus was a common tool in China, utilized in various ways:  add, subtract, multiply, divide, and to calculate fractions and square roots.
    The abacus was made with beads which represented numbers on a base 10 system.
    Children soon learned how to manipulate these beads in order to perform arithmetic computations.
    Although the abacus was a simple tool it is still utilized today in certain countries, and is still common practice in China.

    The first calculator came centuries after the abacus with the invention of the Pascaline, also known as Arithmetic Machine.
    This was designed and assembled by a French mathematician-philosopher by the name of Blaise Pascal in the year on 1642.
    The Pascaline was devised to only do addition and subtraction by manipulating the dials of the numbers.
    Pascal then built 50 of his devices in the span of 10 years.
    <p>Calculators didn’t take great leap of improvement until the1800’s.
    Although the activity of creating these machines increased, it doesn’t mean that they were functioning the way they were programmed toThe reason for this was the technological and mechanical trials developers of early calculators experienced.
    Luckily, the 1800’s was advanced enough to be able to have a few reliable mechanical calculators that were created.
    Thomas de Colmar constructed the Arithmometer in 1820. A step drum technique was used to subtract, multiply and divide.
    55 years later, Willgodt Theophil Odhner produced his own calculator which was named after him, Original Odhner.
    This calculator was a pinwheel or variable cog calculator that was operated with a hand crank to complete the computation it was given.
    The 1800’s century of calculators ended with the the Comptometer by Dorr Felt.
    </p>
    <p>The golden age of calculators took place in the early 1900’s as these machines started to conform to the shape we are used to in the modern day.
    William Hopkins developed the Standard Calculator which was designed with two rows and a total of ten buttons that represented number 0 through 9.
    In the year of 1911, David Sundstrand created the standard ten digit calculator we use today. The golden age came to an end with the first commercial calculators shifting into the consumer market, and at that point calculators were popularized.

    On January 1, 1939 one of the power companies of technology was founded.
    In a small town called Palo Alto located in California, David Packard and Bill Hewlett established their company in a lousy garage.
    Although they worked in a cramped area these two men were able to build their first product, the HP 200A Audio Oscillator.
    The gadget was instantly in high demand amongst engineers. Others besides engineers also viewed it as something applicable to his field of work such as Walt Disney himself.
    Eight of the 200B model was ordered by Disney for the principle of using it as recording equipment and speaker system.
    The speaker system furnished each of his twelve theatres to feature the movie “Fantasia” in 1940.

    Two years later, a German engineer by the name of Konrad Zuse built a computer. This early development was known as the Z3.
    What’s surprising is that this computer was built in complete confinement from all the recent developments being made all around the world.
    The Z3 equips 2,300 relays, performs floating point binary arithmetic, and also has a 22-bit word length.
    The Z3 computer proved valuable for aerodynamic calculations.
    However, the moment of success was bitter-sweet when a bombing raid on Berlin in 1943 destroyed the Z3.
    Luckily Zuse survived and was able to supervise a reconstruction of the Z3 in the 1960’s which can be displayed for viewing as the Deutsches Museum located in Munich.

    IBM or International Business Machines is a an American computer manufacturer, founded by Thomas J. Watson.
    The IBM has been active in the technological world since the 1930’s with their punch card processing equipment.
    The invention of the Mark I computer in the year of 1944 was the one of the most well known machine they had ever created.
    The Mark I was pioneer of that era as it was the first machine to be able to compute long calculations automatically.
    After some time, IBM was prepared to enter the world of product distribution.
    The first computer they produced and released was the IBM 701 EDPM, this marked the first successful general computer in the market.

    The Digital Electronic Universal Computing Engine, or more commonly known as DEUCE was introduced.
    DEUCE was an english electric version of Alan Turing’s Pilot ACE.
    The device was used in science and engineering problems and a few commercial applications.
    Thirty of these electronics were completed.
    <p>The year of 1956 was when Physicist Stan Frankel developed the MINAC at Caltech.
    His enthusiasm for small, general-purpose computers led to this development.
    After developing this the General Precision, defense contractor division called The Librascope purchased the MINAC and renamed in after themselves, the Librascope LGP-30.
    The now LGP-30 was applied to science, engineering, and something as easy as simple data processing.
    During this time this machine was considered a bargain at a price a little lower than $50,000.
    The LGP-30 was the premature version a solo user computer.

    The SAGE system first made its appearance in 1958. SAGE connected 23 hardened computer sites from the US to Canada.
    It’s function was to distinguish incoming soviets bombers and direct interceptor aircraft to annihilate them.
    Actions were directed by operators who initiated it by touching a light gun to the SAGE airspace display.
    Two AN/FSQ-7 computers were incorporated into the air defense system, each used a full megawatt of power to drive the 55,000 vacuum tubes, 175,000 diodes and 13,000 transistors.

    After the multiple inventions by the Apple company, they decided to go public in the year of 1980.
    They became largest IPO since Ford went public in 1956.
    The debut into the stock market was at a valuation of $1.8 billion.
    The success resulted in 40 employees instantly becoming wealthy out of 1,000 employees.
    Later on Apple satisfied the cravings of all consumers in 1984, with the release of the Macintosh.
    The Macintosh included a 128K memory and the price tag at $2,495, surprisingly was as expensive as Mac laptops today.
    However the accomplished feeling was short lived due to the shocking resignation of Steve Jobs in 1985.
    <p>A power struggle between two impressive technology companies was bound to happen, in 1988, Apple sues Microsoft.
    When the once fashionable Macintosh began to lose its trend to the rising Wintel clones, they decided to take action.
    Apple claimed Windows 2.03 infringed on Lisa/Mac audiovisual copyrights.
    The court case concluded in 1989 the Judge kicks out all claims except for a specific ten against Microsoft.
    </p>
    <p>Apple’s continuous strength in the market convinced Steve Jobs enough in order to recruit him as a CEO, even though he was currently a CEO of Pixar.
    The early 2000’s of Apple history included the iTunes Music Store the iPod mini.
    The 21st century marks as the Apple era with unfaltering advancements in the technological era.

    Small steps to big leaps were taken by hundreds of innovative thinkers in order to create the technology based society that exists today.
    From then to now there had been an infinite amount of failures and some achievements but it caused a chain reaction to get to the world we know today.
